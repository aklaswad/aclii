# aclii

**Another Command Line Interface Interface**

# What is this?

aclii is an interface for command line parsers. Define rules between parser and actual program via simple notations in YAML file.

## So this is a command line parser?

 1. **Yes**) This is an another parser for command line inputs, using shellscipts delegate of the actual program, in a bit tricky way.
 2.  **No**) The goal of aclii is not to just parse command line input for actual programs. But to explore the way to define minimum standard of cli input syntax and wrap them into *?aaC[^1]*.



[^1]: (Something) as a code.

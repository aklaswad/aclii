  aclii: |
    aclii, The toolkit for abstract command line interface interface
    This command line tool takes a simple descriptive configuration file and generates a command line option parser for bash, a completion script, and other useful tools.

  aclii.put: |
    Writes artifacts based on the config file to the specified file. Writing to the file is automatically aborted if an error occurs or if a problem is found in the deliverable. For general use, this put command should be used.

  aclii.render: |
    Render generated contents to STDOUT, for testing.
    You can choose one of sub command from the list.

  aclii.playground: |
    The subcommands under playground contain command line parsing and inline scripting demos for the launcher.

  aclii.aclii-completion:
    Prints completion scripts of aclii itself.
